Dotfiles Repo
===================

Repository used to store my .files!

## Overview
Vim configuration using `Pathogen` as a plugin manager. I try to keep it simple and efficient.

## Scripts
Run `make.sh` to install - ( NOTE: Running the script will replace your existing dotfiles by the ones defined in the repo )

To update plugins, run `update_vim_plugins.sh`.
